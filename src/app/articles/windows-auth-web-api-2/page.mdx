I've recently had a situation come up at work where I need to protect our ASP.NET Web API 2 deployment with 
Windows Authentication. We run our web client through Chrome and IE and we needed the NTLM negotiation to 
be handled gracefully. There are a few things that we had to put in place to get this to go. Here they are 
in list form. The code for both the problem and the solution is [here on my github](https://github.com/PlacidBits/ntlmChrome).

- API
  - Add a custom header to the web config to allow the client to send us credentials
    - Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
  - Design a mechanism to configure allowed origins and respond to each request from acceptable domains with a proper Access-Control-Allow-Origin header value
    - The approach I've taken is to:
      - Create a [custom config section](https://github.com/PlacidBits/ntlmChrome/blob/master/TheSolution/Api/Web.config) to hold the acceptable domains
      - Create a [custom handler](https://github.com/PlacidBits/ntlmChrome/blob/master/TheSolution/Api/Handlers/AllowedOriginHandler.cs) to pipe every request through
      - [Register the handler](https://github.com/PlacidBits/ntlmChrome/blob/master/TheSolution/Api/App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs) in App_Start
- Javascript client
  - Send ajax requests "withCredentials"
    - In [jquery](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/), you can do this with the `xhrFields` property of the configuration object.
    - In [angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http), you can use the `withCredentials` property of the configuration object with the `$http` service.

That's it! 

UPDATE 3/2/2016:

When using angular, it's not necessary to send that config object per-request. I've modified the code on my 
github to show that the `$httpProvider` object can be configured to send credentials on every http request by default.

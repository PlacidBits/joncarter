In my day-to-day, I primarily maintain a web API. It&apos;s had limited consumers, but we&apos;re now centralizing a lot of functionality there. The problem we encountered was that only a limited number of developers on the team had experience with RESTful services, or even calling things in general over HTTP from .NET. This post is about the library I created for a team whose primary focus is a Windows Forms app to enable them to interact with our web API using a more familiar paradigm. 

You can dive right into the code [here on my github](https://github.com/PlacidBits/wrapping-api).

## The Setup

- Our API is based on Microsoft&apos;s Web API 2, written in .NET Framework 4.6.1. 
- Our API is not strictly RESTful. Many endpoints are written to handle POSTs when they could more appropriately be GETs, while some GETs should be PUTs, etc. 
- Our API is protected by OAuth 2. 
- Our consumer is a Windows Forms app written in .NET 4.5.1. 
- In the interest of being more accessible to a wider audience, I&apos;ve targeted the example solution in this post to .NET Standard 2.0. If you are interested in seeing the .NET 4.5.1-compatible solution, drop a comment and I&apos;ll be happy to put up an alternative repo. 
- On our development machines, we want to be able to run an instance of the API and point to that from our local instance of the WinForms app. 
- We have a private nuget feed available to distribute our solution.

## Desired Usage Scenario

From our client WinForms app, we want the usage to look something like this:

``` csharp
IApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient(ApiEnvironment.Test);
```

And while we&apos;re making enhancements locally, we want to be able to specify the URL of our API like this:

``` csharp
IApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient(ApiEnvironment.Dev, "http://localhost:5000/");
```

Then, we want to call our operations like so:

``` csharp
var responseDto = await apiClient.CheckHealth();
```

## Architecture

We start our modeling with an `ApiClient` class and an accompanying interface. The key pieces that work with the `ApiClient` class are the DTOs, Operations, and Exceptions. 

### ApiClient

This is the main class our consumers will be interacting with. It exposes:

- A method used to set the environment at runtime
  - In our case, this was useful due to our WinForms app being able to switch to the test environment on the fly.
- A property that tells us what the currently-targeted API environment is.
- All of the operations.

We&apos;ll use the matching interface `IApiClient` to create a singleton instance of this class using a dependency injection framework so that the underlying `HttpClient` and 
associated handler are kept alive the way they need to be.

### DTOs

These are POCOs which acts as the common contract between the consumer(s) and our API. They&apos;re kept in their own separate project so that we can package and publish them 
separately. We&apos;ll talk more in detail about this in the Packaging section.

### Operations

Here, we start with a `BaseOperation` which holds all of the major logic having to do with calling out to the API, handling retries (using Polly), and validating the response - handling 
exceptions when necessary. The `BaseOperation` is abstract and takes the `TRequest` and `TResponse` generic parameters. This class makes it simple to implement any endpoint as its own Operation.

Each of these inherits the BaseOperation and represents an endpoint. In doing so, the Operation is required to implement the abstract Call(TRequest) method. In our example 
`HealthCheckOperation`, we demonstrate using an optional parameter if a request object is unecessary as in cases of RESTful GET requests. Some more examples are available in the Extending section below.

All of the operations are internal, not exposed to consumers. The `IApiClient` interface will be where we choose how to expose these operations to API consumers.

### Exceptions

We have two exceptions which can be handled by the library user:
- ApiSecurityException
  - Thrown when there is an error when obtaining an OAuth token.
- ApiCallException
  - Thrown when an unsuccessful response is returned and otherwise unhandled.

When thrown, both of these exception types will contain the inner exception.

## Extending

When implementing a new endpoint, create an operation class which inherits the `BaseOperation<TRequest, TResponse>` where `TRequest` is the request DTO type and `TResponse` is the response DTO type. 

Example:

``` csharp
class MyOperation : BaseOperation<SomeNewRequestDto, SomeNewResponseDto>
{
 
}
```

Note that, even if you don&apos;t need to send a request body (in the case of a GET) or expect a response body back (in the case of a DELETE), you should still use object as the `TRequest` or `TReponse` as needed. 

You must have one constructor with the signature `(HttpClient, string, Func<Task>)` and pass those parameters through to the base constructor.

Example:

``` csharp
class MyOperation : BaseOperation<SomeNewRequestDto, SomeNewResponseDto>
{
 public MyOperation(HttpClient apiClient, string apiBaseAddress, Func<Task> refreshAccessToken)
 : base(apiClient, apiBaseAddress, refreshAccessToken)
 
}
```

Finally, you must implement the `Task<TResponse> Call(TRequest)` method. This can be done very simply using the base&apos;s `ApiClient` object and `ExecuteAsync` function.

This ensures that the   BaseOperation` will have everything it needs for retries and token-refreshing. 

Once that&apos;s done, you&apos;ll just need to implement the `Task<TResponse> Call(TRequest)` method. This can be done very simply using the base&apos;s `ApiClient` object and `ExecuteAsync` function. 

Example:

``` csharp
class MyOperation : BaseOperation<SomeNewRequestDto, SomeNewResponseDto>
{
 public MyOperation(HttpClient apiClient, string apiBaseAddress, Func<Task> refreshAccessToken)
 : base(apiClient, apiBaseAddress, refreshAccessToken)
 {
 
 }
 
 public override Task<SomeNewResponseDto> Call(SomeNewRequestDto dto = null) => 
  this.ExecuteAsync(this.ApiClient.GetAsync(this.ApiBaseAddress + "some/endpoint"));
}
```

A couple things to note here:

1. The optional parameter dto is how you would handle sending a request that needs no body.
2. The ApiClient is just an instance of System.Net.Http.HttpClient, so you have access to all of those methods for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 

Once the operation is made, we just need to expose it through the `IApiClient` interface and call it inside of `ApiClient`. 

``` csharp
// ApiClient.cs

public Task<SomeNewResponseDto> DoNewOperationAsync(SomeNewRequestDto dto) =>
 new MyOperation(_apiClient, _apiBaseAddress, the.RefreshAccessTokenAsync).Call(dto);
```

## Packaging

When distributing our new library, we want to make the client with its operations available separately from the DTOs they rely on. This way, we can have the 
following references in our respective projects:

- Web API
  - References API.DTOs package in order to return these types from the controller methods
- Consumer App
  - References API.Client package in order to instantiate a client and access all of the operations we&apos;ve defined.
  - References API.DTOs package in order to work with the operations in the same manner they are exposed from the API. 

This is why we&apos;ve created them as two separate projects in our example repo. 

## Conclusion

This was a fun exercise in OOP and code reuse for us. Do you see something we can do differently? Let us know on our socials!
